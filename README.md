# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and 
integrate the processes between software development and IT 
teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster 
and more reliably. The term DevOps was formed by combining the
words “development” and “operations” and signifies a cultural 
shift that bridges the gap between development and operation 
teams, which historically functioned in siloes.
